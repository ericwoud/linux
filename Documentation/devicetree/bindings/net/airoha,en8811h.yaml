title: Airoha EN8811H PHY

maintainers:

description:
  The Airoha EN8811H PHY has the ability to reverse polarity
  on the lines to and/or from the MAC. It is reversed by
  the booleans in the devicetree node of the phy.
  Extra device is pointed to by phandle. Address on the mdio
  bus is always the phy address + 8.
